# Lox interpreter

This is a small Lox walking-tree interpreter written in Rust.
It was built based on the codecrafter challenge, the [original book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) crafting interpreters, the pratt parser article of [Matklad](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html) and this [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNOLaw-_Buc) by Jon Gjengset.
